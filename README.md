calopi-framework
================
A framework to generate PHP classes and code from a MySql database. The basic code for add, edit and delete will be generated. The main idea behind this framework is to use it to create your own framework.

This framework has been developed as part of a project that I was working on. The main issue with other frameworks is that sometimes it takes a lot of time to set up. This framework is very easy to set up and more importantly, as it is a very basic framework, you can modify it as much as you want to make it adapt to your needs.

For issues that are present in this framework, please see the Issues page. There are numerous issues that have not yet been identified. I will be working and correcting these issues as and when time allows me.
